This repository contains code written in java for a sliding puzzle game. The game is a puzzle consisting of a given set of numbers. The user can decide
the amount of empty tiles that he or she would like to be on the board. The board can then be shuffled and the tiles moved in different directions until 
they are placed back in numerical order.

I hope you enjoy!
